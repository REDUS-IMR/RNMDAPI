\details{
The LSS format is a pipe-separated format encoding landings (sales-notes).
 It is provided to IMR on a regular basis from FDIR.
 Column headers are in Norwegian.

 Historically, columns in the landings provided from FDIR has been adapted for each data delivery
 Lately data deliveries has become standardized, but in order to support variants
 adherence to the standardization is not enfored by this function, and data types are inferred from data.
 The parameter 'guessMax' limits how many lines are inspected for data type inference (passed to \code{\link[readr]{read_delim}})
